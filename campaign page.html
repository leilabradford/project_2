			<h2><center>Survivors of domestic violence can go through many different challenging effects after tolerating abuse such as physical, mental, emotional abuse, and etc.
				It may take time to feel safe again after experiencing any type of abuse.
				When people choose to address this pain it may be hard but during the healing process, they can build a lot of strength.
				The effects that abuse can vary because many people respond to things differently such as stress.
				Their age will also have a huge impact on abuse and the frequency and severity of abuse.

				Some mental and emotional effects are depression, anxiety, low self-esteem and questioning the sense of self, suicidal thoughts or attempt, alcohol and drug abuse, feeling unworthy, inability to trust, and unmotivated.
