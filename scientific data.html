	<div class= "item3"><p><center>This graph shows the horrific amount of women having physical contact with a person.
						It shows 8 different contacts involved with 2 or more people. For example, 11.2 people have been forced to have sex with them.
						When you think about it that is a high number and many people are shocked. 
						Those people who are being sexually harassed have families and might not ever heal from this certain situation. 
						For another example, 8.2  people have been physically assaulted. 
						When I mean physically assaulted I mean kicked, dragged, beaten, choked, and or burnt.</center></p>

	<div class= "item4"><center>This graph shows a terrible amount of people getting hurt, physically and verbally.
						The percentages in this graph are very high and outrages.
						For example, 87% of people have been called out of their names, controlled their behavior, and or insulted by another.
						68% of people have been stalked and still to this day are being stalked.
						Being stalked is a very scary thing to go through. 
						You never know what will happen and when.
						Most people do not know that they are being stalked. </center>
