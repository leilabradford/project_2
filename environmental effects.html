			This affects the environment because many people go through tragic events, no matter what age or gender.
			If exposed to abuse it can lead to long-lasting physical, mental, and emotional harm, whether the child is a direct victim or a witness.
			Kids exposed to violence are more likely to suffer severe effects which include: an extended period of stress and/or depression. 
			Although men are sometimes victims, the vast majority are women.
			At least one in every three women globally has been beaten, coerced into sex, or abused in some other way most often by someone she knows, including by her husband or another male family member.
			If in an abusive environment you need to get out as fast as you can. 
			You can not heal in the same environment where you got sick.
			"Children who witness domestic violence or are victims of abuse themselves are at serious risk for long-term physical and mental health problems."
			Women who may be victims of this are at a greater risk of mental health problems, such as depression and psychotic symptoms.
